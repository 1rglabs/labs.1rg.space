      1RG Labs operates differently than a typical consultancy or design studio. Our core belief is that technology is an amplifier that allows organizations to maximize their impact, but deciding how to use technology requires trusted expertise and data-driven decision making.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our experience has been that there is a disconnect between the intuitions of consumers and producers of technology - on the one hand, things that appear to be difficult and expensive to a client are known to be easy and cheap to a technologist. On the other hand, technologists tend to overemphasize technical solutions to social problems.

      We seek to bridge this gap by embedding with organizations that donâ€™t have internal expertise to be their fractional tech team. Our focus is on long-term relationships, providing data insights and expertise to support decision making, and using our close and ongoing relationship with clients to find and implement low-effort/high-impact solutions.
